										<h3>Mary Poppins</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										The Mary Poppins musical is a magical theatrical adaptation that premiered in London's West End in 2004, before making its Broadway debut in 2006. Created through a collaborative effort between Disney Theatrical Productions and legendary theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh, the musical was crafted by an impressive team of theatrical talents. The book was written by Julian Fellowes (known for Downton Abbey), with new songs and additional music by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, building upon the iconic Sherman Brothers songs from the original 1964 Disney film. The production was co-directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne, who also served as co-choreographer, ensuring a blend of theatrical innovation and magical storytelling. The musical ingeniously combines elements from P.L. Travers' original book series and Walt Disney's beloved film, creating a rich, multilayered stage experience that delights audiences of all ages. It ran on Broadway until 2013, closing after an impressive 2,619 performances, and has since toured internationally, becoming a beloved staple of musical theatre. The show won multiple awards and has been praised for its imaginative staging, memorable music, and ability to capture both the whimsy and the deeper emotional themes of the Mary Poppins story.
