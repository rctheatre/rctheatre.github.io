                            administrators, the customer's website is the source or target of a violation of any of the other terms
                            of service or for any other reason which RCT chooses. RCT will use reasonable care in notifying the
                            Customer and in resolving the problem in a method resulting in the least amount of service interference.
                            RCT reserves the right to terminate service without notice for continued and repeated violations of the
                            terms of service. If inappropriate activity is detected, all accounts of the Customer in question will be
                            deactivated until an investigation is complete. Prior notification to the Customer is not assured. In
                            extreme cases, law enforcement will be contacted regarding the activity. The customer will not be credited
                            for the time the customer's machines were suspended. If at any time it becomes necessary for RCT to cancel
                            a customer's service without cause, RCT will provide 10 days advance notice. You may cancel the service at
                            any time by using the "Cancel Subscription" link located on the "Billing" sub-tab of the RCT web application.
                            Cancellation of service does not relieve Subscriber of responsibility for the payment of all accrued
                            charges.

                        <p>
                            The Terms of Service and the relationship between you and RCT shall be governed by the laws of the State of
                            Idaho without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and RCT agree to submit to the personal and
                            exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Madison, ID.
                        </p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;"><a href="#">Waiver And Severability Of Terms</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            The failure of RCT to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not
                            constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a
                            court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
                            endeavor to give effect to the party's intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions
                            of the Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.
                        </p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;"><a href="#">Statute Of Limitations</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out
                            of or related to use of RCT services or the Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such
                            claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
                        </p>
