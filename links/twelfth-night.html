									<br>
									<h3 style="text-align: center;">Available Roles</h3>
									<p>
										<strong>Viola:</strong> Brave, bold, loyal, and impulsive. <br>
										Viola is a young woman who gets shipwrecked and separated from her twin, whom she believes is dead. She is bold in her choices and goes undercover as a servant in Illyria. Her bold decisions get her in trouble when she realizes she has fallen in love with the duke. <br>
										<br><strong>Olivia:</strong> Proper, indecisive, strong-willed, and persistent. <br>
										Olivia is a wealthy heiress in Illyria. She is proper and feminine, although a little melodramatic when it comes to both love and loss. Her unrequited love for Cesario brings out comedic aspects in the play, and his (her) attempts to dissuade them only make Olivia fall for him more. <br>
										<br><strong>Duke Orsino: </strong>melodramatic, noble, devoted, witty, and self-absorbed. <br>
										The Duke of Illyria. Despite her lack of feelings for him, he is desperately in love with Olivia. His love attempts are overdramatic, and he is persistent in his affections. <br>
										<br><strong>Sebastian: </strong>noble, emotionally expressive, bold, and impulsive. <br>
										Viola’s twin brother, who believes that Viola is dead. Antonio rescues him and makes his way to Illyria. Being Viola’s twin, they behave very similarly, making bold choices for survival and love. Sebastian’s impulsivity leads him to make an unconventional choice in the name of love. <br>
										<br><strong>Feste: </strong>Quirky, witty, underestimated, and brass. <br>
										The fool. He works for Olivia, although not exclusively, and while he is the “fool” he actually is the voice of reason in the play, though his reasoning is dismissed because of the nature of his character. <br>
										<br><strong>Sir Toby Belch: </strong>Drunkard, Jovial, Mischievous, Boisterous and Scheming. <br>
										Sir Toby enjoys a carefree life, often plotting with Maria to cause chaos. Despite his lack of responsibility, he has a strong loyalty to his niece Oliva and a desire to maintain his social standing<br>
										<br><strong>Malvolio: </strong>Pompous, Self-Righteous, Arrogant, Ambitious and Disdainful of Others.<br>
										Malvolio stands out among the characters of the play for having such a disregard and disdain for the playful and chaotic nature of the show. His arrogance ultimately makes him easily manipulated by Sir Toby and the others<br>
										<br><strong>Sir Andrew: </strong>Foolish, Bumbling, Gullible, Cowardly. <br>
										Sir Andrew is often the butt of many a joke without realizing and is easily lead and manipulated by Sir Toby. He fancies himself a strong suitor for Olivia, but often proves himself awkward and incompetent.<br>
										<br><strong>Maria: </strong>Whitty, Clever, Scheming, Assertive, Sharp.<br>
										Maria is a maid in Olivia’s household, however she is seen to be willing to stand up to those of a higher class, especially Malvolio and Sir Toby. She is often the driving force behind the antics of Sir Toby, bringing much of the comedy of the play<br>
										<br><strong>Antonio: </strong>Loyal, Brave, Devoted, Impulsive. <br>
										The man who rescued Sebastian from the sea, Antiono feels a strong sense of loyalty to his friend, to the point of risking his well-being by following him into Illyria despite danger of his own enemies, also showing impulsivity. He is kind and sincere, and often times overcome with melancholy. <br>
										<br><strong>Sea Captain: </strong>Fatherly, protective, anguished. <br>
										The sea captain who is shipwrecked with Olivia. Feeling a deep sense of remorse and guilt, he offers to take care of Viola as she is in Illyria, due to feeling personally responsible for the shipwreck. Although his character is mostly silent, he is very expressive and conveys a lot in his unspoken emotions. <br>
										<br><strong>Musician: </strong><br>
										This is a non-speaking role, who plays music at the beginning of the tone and often sets the tone of different scenes. Must be able to play either the lute, flute, guitar or ukelele for this role. <br>
										<br><strong>Curio and Valentine: </strong>Proper, gentlemanly and friendly. <br>
										<br><strong>Gentlemen attending Duke Orsino: </strong><br>
										They seek to help him in his love endeavors through various means, and try to cheer him up when his unrequited love brings him down. <br>
